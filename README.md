Scenario 1: Multilinear Regression – Student Academic Performance

Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams

This scenario uses the student performance dataset to predict final exam scores using multilinear regression. Academic, behavioral, and lifestyle factors such as study hours, attendance, parental education, test preparation, and sleep hours are analyzed. The target variable is calculated as the average of math, reading, and writing scores. The process includes data preprocessing, encoding, handling missing values, feature scaling, and model training. Performance is evaluated using MSE, RMSE, and R² score, with visualizations used to assess prediction accuracy and feature impact.

Scenario 2: Polynomial Regression – Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Prediction

Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/autompg-dataset

This scenario uses the Auto MPG dataset to predict vehicle fuel efficiency using polynomial regression to model non-linear relationships. Engine features such as displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, and model year are analyzed. The process includes data preprocessing, polynomial feature generation, model training, and evaluation using MSE, RMSE, and R² score, along with visualizations to assess prediction accuracy.
